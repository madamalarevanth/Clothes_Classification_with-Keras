# Clothes_Classification_with-Keras

the project is on clothes classification .i used mnist dataset(fashion_mnist) for the classification application 
The images each are 28 x 28 arrays, with pixel values ranging between 0 and 255

 The labels are arrays of integers, ranging from 0 to 9. These correspond to the class of clothing the image represents:

Digit	Class

0	T-shirt/top

1	Trouser

2	Pullover

3	Dress

4	Coat

5	Sandal

6	Shirt

7	Sneaker

8	Bag

9	Ankle boot

The core data structure of Keras is a model, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, a linear stack of layers.

 the network consists of a sequence of two dense layers

The first dense layer has 128 nodes (or neurons) using a relu activation function 

 the rectifier is an activation function defined as the positive part of its argument:
 f(x)=x^{+}=\max(0,x)
 A unit employing the rectifier is also called a rectified linear unit (ReLU).
 
The second (and last) layer is a 10-node using softmax activation function 

 the softmax function, softargmax,[1] or normalized exponential function, is a generalization of the logistic function that "squashes" a K-dimensional vector Z of arbitrary real values to a K-dimensional vector sigma(z) of real values, for K>=2, where each entry is in the interval (0, 1), and all the entries add up to 1.


 â€”this returns an array of 10 probability scores that sum to 1. Each node contains a score that indicates the probability that the current image belongs to one of the 10 digit classes.
